#subtitle: Building relations with the other political parties of Germany.

= Inter-Party Relationships

The <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> cannot govern by itself yet. Because we do not have an electoral majority, we need the support of other parties. Recently, our governments have consisted of the <span style="color: #000000;">We</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">im</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">ar</span> Coalition of the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>, <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span>, and [? if ddp_name == "DDP" and not lvp_formed: <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**Democratic**</span>?][? if ddp_name == "DStP" and not lvp_formed: <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**State**</span>?][? if lvp_formed: <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**Liberal People's**</span>?] parties. [? if cvp_formed: However the formation of the <span style="color: #000000;">**[+ z_party_name +]**</span> has only really made cooperation with the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">liberals</span> possible. ?] We can reach out and build additional connections with these parties, or perhaps we can stand alone.

The <span style="color: #700000;">communists</span> are suspicious of our overtures, especially the <span style="color: #8B0000;">Stalinist</span> leadership, who persist in calling us "<span style="color: #c00000;">social</span> <span style="color: #7A3C00;">fascists</span>". However, connections are made at the grassroots and local levels.

@kpd_rectification_of_history

One stumbling block for our relations with the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> is our history of conflict, dating back to 1918 and 1919. The <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> is especially contemptuous of Gustav Noske, the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> "bloodhound" who reportedly ordered the violent suppression of the <span style="color: #700000;">Spartacist</span> uprising and other <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> revolts. They also blame us for the deaths of Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht, two <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>-turned-<span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> leaders who were killed during the suppression of the uprising.

For further improvements in <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> relations, it might be necessary to expel Noske, and hold some sort of commemoration for Luxemburg and Liebknecht.

- @yes_history: Yes, we must apologize for our past actions.
- @no_history: No, we have no need to apologize.

As part of normalizing relations with the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span>, we have to acknowledge the wrongdoings of our past. We have expelled Noske, and have held public commemorations for those killed by troops during the uprisings.

This leads to tensions with the moderates and reformists within our party, and criticism from the <span style="color: #000000;">conservative</span> and <span style="color: #C0A054;">liberal</span> parties.

@no_history
on-arrival: nsdap_relation -= 3

We have no need to apologize for the actions of Ebert and Noske; it is the <span style="color: #700000;">communists</span>' fault for launching a violent insurrection.

After the success of the coalition government with the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span>, they are much more amenable to us.

@kpd_blutmai
on-arrival: nsdap_relation += 3*(1 - dissent); popcon_dissent += 1

After the events of Blütmai, reconciling with the <span style="color: #700000;">Communists</span> is difficult, if not impossible. Nevertheless, we must try.

We are currently in opposition to the [? if z_party_name != "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span>?][? if z_party_name == "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">**CVP**</span>?]-led government, but that does not preclude the general building of feelings of good will.

@center_coalition

We are currently coalition partners with them, so improving relations comes naturally.

@center_bruning
on-arrival: z_relation += 5*(1 - dissent)

The Brüning semi-<span style="color: #808080;">autocratic</span> regime makes building friendly relations difficult, but not impossible.

It's not exactly easy to get the <span style="color: #000000;">Christians</span> to like us again—but it's not impossible either. We will leverage our connections with their <span style="color: #FF7F00;">Christian Left</span> and Labor factions to lay the groundwork for a potential reconciliation between our two parties.

@dvp_stresemann

Gustav Stresemann, the leader of the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> is the best foreign policy leaders of the republic, and while he has previously expressed <span style="color: #808080;">monarchist</span> tendencies, he has been friendly towards us.

@dvp_loss

With the death of Gustav Stresemann, the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> is much less likely to be accommodating of us. In addition, the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">liberal</span> parties are electorally in decline, so perhaps our efforts are best spent elsewhere.

However, given the influence of the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> among the other <span style="color: #808080;">right</span>-leaning parties [? if president == "Hindenburg": and with President Hindenburg ?], it can still be helpful to influence them.

Stresemann's influence over the right wing of the <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span> helps sway some more reluctant party members towards us.

@spd_alone

Whether it is because we *cannot* or *will not*, we do not make ties with other parties at this moment.

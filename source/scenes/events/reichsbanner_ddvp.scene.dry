= The <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**DDVP**</span> and the Reichsbanner

The Reichsbanner has increasingly militarized, acquiring arms, conducting paramilitary training, and attracting a stream of <span style="color: #9B0000;">radicalized</span> <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> members. The <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**DDVP**</span> in particular is offended by this, as many of its members originate from the semi-monarchist <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> and even have <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**Stahlhelm**</span> memberships. The organization's militarization has provided them with a pretext to sever formal ties with this <span style="color: #000000;">rep</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">ubl</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">ican</span> organization.

- @let_go: Let the <span style="color: #FFCC00;">liberals</span> go.
- @lower_militancy: We must lower the Reichsbanner's militancy.
- @keep_them: Can we convince them that a militant Reichsbanner is necessary for defending the Republic?

@let_go
on-arrival: vb_strength *= 0.95; z_relation -= 3; ddvp_old_relation -= 5; ddvp_right += 3; pro_republic -= 3; ddvp_leave_reichsbanner = 1

We have judged that the Reichsbanner's militancy is more important than maintaining a coalition with the <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**DDVP**</span>. The Reichsbanner members affiliated with the <span style="color: #FFCC00;">liberals</span> leave, and this may inspire the [? if z_party_name != "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span>?][? if z_party_name == "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">**CVP**</span>?] to follow suit.

// TODO: this should make it harder to form Weimar coalitions


@lower_militancy
on-arrival: vb_militancy *= 0.5

Bowing to the <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**DDVP**</span>'s demands, we reduce the Reichsbanner's military training, thus inducing them to stay.


@keep_them
unavailable-subtitle: They are unable to be convinced at this time.
choose-if: strife >= 3 and ddvp_old_relation >= 55 and ddvp_ideology != "Right"
on-arrival: ddvp_left += 3; ddvp_old_relation += 3; old_middle_dnvp += 3; old_middle_ddvp -= 3; pro_republic += 3

Seeing the strife that has filled Germany's streets, the <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**DDVP**</span> seem to be convinced that it is necessary for the Reichsbanner to be militarized, and will not leave the organization. Unfortunately, many die-hard <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**Stahlhelm**</span> members within the party are constantly pressing for a reversal of this policy.

= Secret Reichswehr Meeting

Through our intelligence work, the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> has received a copy of minutes of a meeting between <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> leaders Gregor Strasser, Hermann Göring, and [? if not rohm_explode: Ernst Röhm?][? if rohm_explode: the leader of the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span>?], with former General Edwin von Stülpnagel, a close ally of Schleicher.

The topic of the conference was about possible joint action between the Reichswehr and the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span>, if the leftists were to make a move following the elections.

This all but confirms our suspicions that General Schleicher is conspiring with the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> against the <span style="color: #000000;">rep</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">ubl</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">ican</span> forces. Our relations with the "Red General" has worsened.

The invitation for a direct meeting between Theodor Leipart, leader of the ADGB, and von Schleicher is declined. Instead, a larger meeting is held, including Papen, his Interior Minister, and the ADGB’s co-chairs.

At the meeting, the union leaders confront Schleicher over alleged secret agreements with the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span>, prompting both Schleicher and Papen to strike a more conciliatory tone in response to union complaints about unfair government treatment. Schleicher denies any such deals with the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span>, insisting that the government's highest priority is reducing unemployment. Papen also requests the unions to use their influence to persuade the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> to give the government time to deliver results.

By the end of the meeting, the three unionists are left impressed by Schleicher, who hints at possible concessions to a “patriotic labor movement.” A line of communication between the ADGB and the government remains open—much to Wels’s frustration, as he aims to maintain a united front against the regime.

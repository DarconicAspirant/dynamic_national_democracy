= Gauleiter Conference Leaked

Berlin's former police chief and <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> member Albert Grzesinski, who's also apart of our executive committee, has brought a report received from an informant about a meeting of <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> regional officials. The discussions is of what would happen if the elections were to bring a <span style="color: #7A3C00;">far</span>-<span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span> majority; an immediate state of emergency, suspension of parts of the constitution, non-secret supervised balloting, all with the support of the Defense Minister von Schleicher.

If a majority isn't received, the alternative would be to pit the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span> and von Schleicher's Reichswehr against Papen, and if Papen refused to act, they would be forced to take action themselves.

title: Immediately strengthen the Reichsbanner in response.
subtitle: -1 resource
unavailable-subtitle: Not enough resources.
choose-if: resources >= 1
on-arrival: revolutionary_urgency += 1; resources -= 1; vb_strength += 200; vb_militancy += 0.05

This development has persuaded the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> leadership—and Otto Wels himself—to grant the Reichsbanner independent authority and financial support, which its leaders deem essential.

Such backing is especially critical following our loss of Prussia and its well-equipped police force.

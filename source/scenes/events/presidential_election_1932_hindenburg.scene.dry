= Hindenburg's Announcement

President Hindenburg has expressed his reluctance to run for re-election. At 84 years old, he prefers to spend his remaining years in retirement free from the burdens of his high office. While he has been open to serving longer if his term were extended by the Reichstag, the failure of those efforts, combined with his unwillingness to endure a grueling presidential campaign, has caused concern, particularly for Kurt von Schleicher[? if bruning_toleration_time: and Chancellor [+ chancellor +], on whom he depends to enact his decrees?].

Heinrich Sahm, the Mayor of Berlin, has formed a re-election committee to persuade Hindenburg to run again. This effort has included the collection of over [+ hindenburg_signatures +] million signatures and appeals from a wide array of figures and political parties across German society, including Artur Mahraun of the Young German Order, and controversial former Defense Ministers Otto Gessler and Gustav Noske.

Impressed by the public support, Hindenburg is reconsidering his decision but insists that his candidacy must be backed by the German Right and veteran organizations rather than the German Left and Center. [? if not hitler_deported: Hitler?][? if hitler_deported: Goebbels?], Hugenberg, their parties, and the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**Stahlhelm**</span>—aligned with the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">national</span> <span style="color: #3E88B3;">opposition</span>—have demanded concessions in exchange for their support, despite the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**Stahlhelm**</span>'s general friendliness toward Hindenburg and its belief that he is one of their own. However, Hindenburg sees these demands as an affront to his personal honor and refuses to tie his candidacy to the dismissal of the current government or the appointment of Hugenberg and Hitler.

view-if: not hindenburg_run

President Hindenburg has decided not to run for re-election, citing his health problems and old age as the primary reasons. He feels that the current national situation doesn't warrant a reelection campaign.

This development could be either beneficial or detrimental to us. If we wanted to rally behind Hindenburg to oppose Hitler and the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span>, the absence of a unifying, widely supported national figure—one capable of garnering support from both the moderate left and right—leaves us at a disadvantage. On the other hand, if we decide to run a candidate of our own, the lack of someone with Hindenburg's charisma could make it easier for us to secure a victory.

The absence of a candidate for the German middle and moderate right to rally behind creates a vacuum, which will likely be filled as other parties announce their candidates in the near future.

Together with the unconditional backing of the Kyffhäuser League, this has given Hindenburg the motivation to run for re-election, convinced his primary support would come from the right.?] Of course, a multitude of other factors contributed, including the signature campaign and Schleicher's persistence.

The Sahm committee for Hindenburg's re-election has been dissolved and replaced by a much larger, national "United Hindenburg Committees" organization, which will work in coordination with the various local Hindenburg committees across the country. With the appointment of Westarp and Gereke to top positions, and the exclusion of <span style="color: #c00000;">socialist</span> and [? if z_party_name != "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span>?][? if z_party_name == "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">**CVP**</span>?] politicians, they are attempting to position Hindenburg as the candidate of the moderate right.

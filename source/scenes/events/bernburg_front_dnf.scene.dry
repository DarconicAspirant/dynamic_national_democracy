= The Bernburg Front

The <span style="color: #7A3C00;">far</span>-<span style="color: #003755;">right</span> parties and paramilitaries - the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> (and its paramilitary the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span>), the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**Stahlhelm**</span> paramilitary group, and the <span style="color: #003755;">**DNF**</span> - have united to form the Bernburg Front, as a force dedicated to the overthrow of the current government. 

However, this show of unity lacks substance, as Hugenberg, Hitler, and the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**Stahlhelm**</span> compete against one another to assert themselves as the leader of the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">national</span> <span style="color: #003755;">opposition</span>. Hitler's erratic behavior—such as vanishing from the podium when <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**Stahlhelm**</span> detachments march by—has offended many conservatives[? if bruning_time:, and inter-party polemics may only serve to reinforce Brüning against their pressures?]. Luckily, the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>'s leadership has dissuaded many influential industrialists from taking part in this gathering. However, the inclusion of the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**Stahlhelm**</span> in this alliance pressures the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> to move toward closer ties.

- @strategy: We must develop a coherent strategy to combat the Right.
- @confronting_nazis.iron_front: We must form the <span style="color: #c00000;">Iron</span> <span style="color: #1A1A1A;">Front</span>!
- @iron_front: The <span style="color: #c00000;">Iron</span> <span style="color: #1A1A1A;">Front</span> will be our answer!

We do not yet have a coherent strategy for combatting the fascists. We must develop one as soon as possible.

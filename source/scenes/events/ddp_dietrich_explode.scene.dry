= Hermann Dietrich resigns!

[? if ddp_ideology != "Left": Hermann Dietrich has failed to meet the expectations of many within the party, with only the local organizations in Hamburg, Baden, and Württemberg showing any real signs of activity. Theodor Heuss has been particularly eager to find a replacement for Dietrich, but so far, no one has been willing to take on the leadership of this struggling party. Both Hermann Höpker-Aschoff, the party’s former leader in Prussia, and his successor have declined the role. ?][? if ddp_ideology == "Left": Since Dietrich's election to the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span>'s leadership, the party has shifted to the left, making him—the candidate of the business wing—increasingly unpopular within the party. As a result, a vote of no confidence has been put forth, aiming to replace him with a more left-wing and energetic leader. ?]

[? if ddp_ideology != "Left": The only viable option left would be Heuss himself, but he remains reluctant, preferring to focus on his family. With no prominent politician willing to take leadership, Dietrich remains as acting chairman until they do. ?][? if ddp_ideology == "Left": If the vote succeeds, which seems likely, Lemmer has shown reluctance about running for leadership again and may choose to endorse someone else for the position. ?]

Theodor Heuss a journalist turned politician and a rising star has been elected as the chairman of the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span>. Although affiliated with the business wing of the party, his determined and genuine support for <span style="color: #FFCC00;">liberal</span> <span style="color: #586593;">democracy</span> has earned him support from the party's left wing. 

Heuss's victory strengthens the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span>'s cooperation with us, as he has urged his party members that it is crucial to save German democracy. A visible revival in party activities has already been seen, but funding still remains a major obstacle. Perhaps the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span> isn't <span style="color: #ff0000;">moribund</span> after all?

Reinhold Maier, a major figure in Württemberg politics and a rising star in the dying party, has been elected chairman of the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span>. Youthful and energetic, he is not bound by traditional liberal principles like many veteran members of the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span>, making him a strong choice for a party plagued by defeatism and internal strife.

For us, however, his position within the business wing means we have yet to see significant improvements in cooperation compared to Dietrich’s tenure. Anyhow, a visible revival in party activities is already underway, though funding remains a persistent obstacle. Perhaps the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span> isn't <span style="color: #ff0000;">moribund</span> after all?

face-image: img/portraits/stolper.jpg

Gustav Stolper, a German-Austrian economist and the son of <span style="color: #005EB8;">Jewish</span> immigrants from Poland, has been elected chairman of the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span>, reinforcing a stereotype the party has long struggled to dispel. Despite this, Stolper—renowned for the economic program bearing his name—could be exactly what the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span> needs to revitalize its middle-class support.

Relations have improved compared to Dietrich’s tenure, as Stolper's strained ties with parties to the right of the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span>—due to anti-Semitism—have made cooperation with us easier. Meanwhile, a visible revival in party activities is already underway, though funding remains a persistent obstacle.

Marie-Elisabeth Lüders, the second most important woman in the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span>, and easily the most active advocate for the rights and wellbeing of women, children, and the workers of Germany, is elected to the leadership of the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span>. This victory comes with the backing of Ernst Lemmer and his liberal trade unions, who have gained significant influence in recent months.

Our relationship with the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span> has greatly improved compared to how it was under Dietrich. Lüders is a strong internationalist and has previously advocated for Pan-European cooperation, which will benefit us in future negotiations. She was also one of the strongest opponents of the merger with the Young German Order, arguing against their antisemitism. However, it remains to be seen whether she will gain more votes than she loses due to her feminism, as many refuse to support her purely out of misogyny.

With no candidate able to secure a majority, everyone has unanimously agreed to dissolve the party, because no one wants to deal with this. However, the local organizations have reconstituted themselves as the "National Democratic Party of Germany", not wanting the party to die so easily.

You are no fun. Stolper is eventually chosen as a compromise candidate.

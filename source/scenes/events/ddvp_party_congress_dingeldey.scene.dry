= <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**DDVP**</span> Party Vote

Dingeldey's tenure as leader of the <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**DDVP**</span> has been marked by a sharp decline in the party’s vote share and a decline in organizational activity. His right-wing positions and close ties to industrialists have made him a divisive figure, with many blaming the party’s rightward shift and association with big business for its dwindling appeal.

Despite his unpopularity, the industrial-right remains firmly behind him, giving him a chance to survive the recently introduced vote of no confidence by the left of the party.

Unexpectedly—and unfortunately for us—Dingeldey has survived the vote of no confidence. This victory grants him a renewed mandate to further entrench industrial and business interests within the party while adopting an increasingly antagonistic stance toward the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>.

As expected, Dingeldey's disastrous leadership of the <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**DDVP**</span> has finally led to his ousting. The party is now reluctant to elect another right-wing leader, ensuring that at least one of Dingeldey’s former rivals will take his place.

Theodor Heuss, a rising star and former member of the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span>, has been elected chairman of the <span style="color: #FFCC00;">Liberal People's Party</span>. Backed primarily by the 'Social Republican Circle,' composed of former <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span> members and liberal intellectuals and newspapers, Heuss has also garnered support from the broader party due to his decently conservative stances on economic and national issues.

Heuss's victory empowers the '<span style="color: #c00000;">Social</span> <span style="color: #000000;">Rep</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">ubl</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">ican</span>' wing, strengthening our cooperation. Despite his personal leanings toward the right, Heuss remains one of the most committed and genuine supporters for <span style="color: #FFCC00;">liberal</span> <span style="color: #586593;">democracy</span> within the <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**DDVP**</span>.

Despite this, Dietrich is a huge step up from Dingeldey's leadership, and is open to cooperation. However, his leadership has been quite uninspiring, to say the least.

Julius Curtius, Stresemann's successor in foreign affairs and a former member of the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>, has won the vote to succeed Luther for the chairmanship. Curtius is supported by the 'Pragmatic Center', and was put forth as a compromise candidate.

Reinhold Maier, a major figure in Württemberg politics and a rising star in the struggling party, has been elected chairman of the <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**DDVP**</span>. Youthful and energetic, he is less bound by dogma than many veteran members, making him a strong choice for a party plagued by defeatism and internal strife.

His association with the former <span style="color: #D3C24D;">[+ ddp_name +]</span>'s business wing isn't the best news for future cooperation, but he remains a significant improvement over Dingeldey's leadership.

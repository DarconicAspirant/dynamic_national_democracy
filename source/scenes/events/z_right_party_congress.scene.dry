= 1930 [? if z_party_name != "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span>?][? if z_party_name == "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">**CVP**</span>?] Conference

With Hugenberg’s hardliners tightening their grip over the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>, any prospect of a merger with the <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span> has evaporated. But a new path to expansion has emerged. The party leadership now turns its attention to the fragmented remains of the anti-Hugenberg right—figures like Westarp and his <span style="color: #0087DC;">**KVP**</span>—as potential candidates for absorption.

The consequences are obvious. Bringing these elements into the fold would drag the <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span> further to the right—foreclosing any serious cooperation with the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> and entrenching the party within the conservative camp.

A vote is now before them: merge with the <span style="color: #0087DC;">**KVP**</span>—or continue the status quo.

- @cvp_kvp_merger: The <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span> absorbs the <span style="color: #0087DC;">**KVP**</span>!
- @status_quo: The <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span> has rejected a merger with the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> splinters.

The <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span> has officially absorbed the much smaller <span style="color: #0087DC;">**KVP**</span>, expanding its reach to the right. Unsurprisingly, this has severely strained relations between our two parties, as former <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> figures like Westarp remain openly hostile to any cooperation with the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>.

Still, the party’s transformation marches on. To mark the merger—and its progress toward becoming an interconfessional Volkspartei—it has formally rebranded itself as the <i>Christliche Volkspartei</i> (<span style="color: #000000;">Christian People's Party</span>)—an effort to finally shed its old, Catholic-associated <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span> label.

The status quo prevails. The <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span> and the <span style="color: #0087DC;">**KVP**</span> will remain separate—at least for now. Perhaps this is proof enough that the party still values cooperation with us over chasing after every fragment of the old Right.

Even so, the party’s transformation presses on. To cement its evolution into an interconfessional *Volkspartei*, it has formally rebranded itself as the <i>Christliche Volkspartei</i> (<span style="color: #000000;">Christian People's Party</span>)—a move to finally shed its old, Catholic-associated <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span> label.

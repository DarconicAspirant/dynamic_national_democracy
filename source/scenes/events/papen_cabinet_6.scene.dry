= The 'Potempa Five' Stand Trial for Murder

The so-called "Potempa Five"—the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span> men who broke into the home of a <span style="color: #830000;">**Communist**</span> miner and brutally beat him to death—are set to stand trial in Papen’s newly established special courts, designed to fast-track death penalty cases. The <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> have wasted no time in slandering the victim, referring to him as subhuman for being both <span style="color: #830000;">**Communist**</span> and Polish, in a vile attempt to sway public opinion in favor of the murderers.

Convicted! The five <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span> men have been sentenced to death for their atrocious crime. Yet the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> have only intensified their propaganda, portraying the killers as national heroes and the murder as a patriotic act. This grotesque campaign has emboldened the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span>, with the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> now calling for an escalation in violence to render Germany "ungovernable."

Rumors have arisen that Papen’s government may commute the sentences to win <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> support when the Reichstag reconvenes. But this has dealt a serious blow to [+ nsdap_chancellor +]’s so-called “oath of legality.” Public revulsion at the Potempa murders—and the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span>’ open approval—has triggered a backlash among their former supporters. Many religious and conservative voters are horrified, and even President Hindenburg is reportedly sickened by the affair.

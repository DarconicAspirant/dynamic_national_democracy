= Constitution Day

It has been thirteen years since the adoption of the <span style="color: #000000;">We</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">im</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">ar</span> Constitution in 1919—a date still marked as a public holiday in its commemoration.

However, Papen has chosen this occasion to unveil his plan for a so-called “New State”: an authoritarian constitution that would merge the offices of chancellor and Prussian minister president, free the chancellor from reliance on Reichstag confidence, and establish an aristocratic upper house of parliament appointed by the president. In practice, this would transform Germany into a dictatorship run by elites.

Papen’s plan bears obvious similarities to the former <span class="tooltip-text" title="good mod">*Kaiserreich*</span>, and given his <span style="color: #808080;">monarchist</span> sympathies, it’s clear that restoring the monarchy remains his ultimate goal.

[? if largest_party == "NSDAP": Surprisingly, the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> have also criticized the planned “New State”—ironically invoking democratic principles to argue that the largest party in parliament should be the one to form a government. ?]

We have launched a propaganda campaign aimed at shifting public opinion back in favor of the system. But as always, you can’t effectively preach to hungry people.

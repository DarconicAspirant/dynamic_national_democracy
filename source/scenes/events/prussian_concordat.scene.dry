= Prussian Concordat

Despite our Otto Braun losing his position as the Minister-President of Prussia, he still possesses great influence within state politics and together with <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span> members, have negotiated a concordat with the Vatican. 

- @sign_concordat: The Prussian government shall sign the concordat.

We have signed a Concordat between the Free State of Prussia and the Roman Catholic Church, guaranteeing religious freedom for Catholics in Prussia. This sets the stage for the negotiation of a national Concordat covering all of Germany.

[? if dnvp_ideology == "Radical": The Catholic members of the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> in Prussia are in open conflict with their leadership over the vote, with many leaving the party. ?]

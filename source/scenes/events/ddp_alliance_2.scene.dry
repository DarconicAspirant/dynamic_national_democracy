= The <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span>'s Proposal

With the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span>'s disastrous showing last election, only winning [+ ddp_r +]% of seats, they've reconsidered our offer for an electoral list connection. Even Heuss is convinced that they need to do something. 

- @ddp_alliance_yay: The party votes...

@ddp_alliance_yay
on-arrival: ddp_alliance = 1; ddp_alliance_glaze = 1 if ddp_ideology == "Left" and ddp_leader == "Lemmer"; liberal_cooperation -= 8; bourgeois_cooperation -= 3; lvp_relation += 5; pro_republic += ddp_votes; ddp_left += 3; ddp_cohesion -= 2; rural_ddp *= 0.7; old_middle_ddp *= 0.8; new_middle_ddp *= 0.95; workers_ddp += 3 if ddp_alliance_glaze; new_middle_ddp += 2 if ddp_alliance_glaze; old_middle_ddp -= 1 if ddp_alliance_glaze; rural_ddp -= 1 if ddp_alliance_glaze; pro_republic += 3 if ddp_alliance_glaze

After their internal vote, the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span> accepts our offer. The party suffers electorally from their association with us, even if many right-wingers stress it as nothing more than a technical list connection. Anyhow, the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span> will receive more parliamentary seats now.

[? if ddp_ideology == "Left" and ddp_leader == "Lemmer": Lemmer has decided to take things a step further, and has further increased electoral cooperation between our parties. Perhaps this alliance will last more than just one election? ?]

@pres_election

The first round has ended, with no candidate receiving an absolute majority of votes. Hitler's results were disappointing to him and his party, [? if not hitler_support_hindenburg: but he has chosen to remain as a candidate?][? if hitler_support_hindenburg: resulting in him dropping out and supporting Hindenburg instead?]. [? if spd_support_thalmann == 0 and kpd_support_spd == 0: Thälmann has also remained in the running, refusing to back what they view as the lesser evil.?] 

Following last month’s events, Duesterberg has withdrawn from the race. His votes are expected to be [? if not hitler_support_hindenburg: split between Hindenburg and Hitler?][? if hitler_support_hindenburg: redistributed to Hindenburg?]. However, Hugenberg’s <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> continues to withhold an official endorsement in favor of any candidate.

[? if thalmann_votes_rnd_1 > thalmann_votes_disp: The decline of [+ communist_candidate_1932 +]'s vote share is largely attributed to the futility of his campaign, with estimates suggesting that a significant portion of his former voters have either defected to Hitler or abstained from the second round.

It is seen that [+ nsdap_candidate_1932 +] was the one to benefit from Duesterberg's withdrawal, rather than [+ reactionary_candidate_1932 +], having garnered 60% of his former voters.

As expected, the incumbent Hindenburg wins the presidency. Let's hope he continues to keep the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> out of power.

[? if spd_support_hindenburg and not bruning_time: The fact that, even with the votes from the <span style="color: #c00000;">socialists</span> and <span style="color: #000000;">Catholics</span>, Hindenburg has failed to secure a majority in the first round has been a great embarrassment to him. Realizing that many of his former supporters have turned to Hitler, he is now shifting further to the right. ?]

[? if spd_support_hindenburg and bruning_time: The fact that [+ reactionary_candidate_1932 +] owed his reelection to the parties who opposed him in 1925 rather than those with whom he felt the closest natural affinity with is a source of great personal anguish to the aging president and severely strained his relations with Brüning and the conservatives who had orchestrated his reelection campaign. ?]

// TODO: Consider chancellor other than levi

Meanwhile, he calls on the left-wing paramilitaries to organize worker uprisings and form revolutionary councils all across Germany.

// TODO: Government program
Karl Liebknecht of the SPD has won the presidency. He immediately dismissed the current government and appointed Paul Levi as the chancellor of a "Provisional Revolutionary Government". The new government is composed almost entirely by the SPD, with the inclusion of some USPD dissidents. It immediately proceeds to announce a program of mass nationalizations and expropriations as well as complete restructuring of the military and police force. As the left-wing paramilitaries pressure USPD deputies to tolerate the new government, it becomes clear that the situation will soon escalate to civil war. What are our options in the meantime?

= Reichsexekution of Thuringia

President [+ president +] has invoked the *Reichsexekution* to dismiss the Thuringian government, citing its "inability to maintain order" amidst escalating clashes between the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span>, Reichsbanner, and the increasingly militant <span style="color: #700000;">**RFB**</span>.

However, the true motivation is clear: the left-wing coalition governing Thuringia poses a direct threat to the conservative and nationalist establishment in Germany.

The <span style="color: #700000;">communists</span> protesting in the streets are brutally suppressed, with the Reichswehr patrolling the streets, restricting political gatherings, and turning a blind eye to the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span> as they harass local party officials.

Hindenburg appoints <span style="color: #7FCEB1;">**CNBLP**</span> member Erwin Baum as *Reichskommissar* to govern Saxony, tasked with dismantling our reforms and violently suppressing the <span style="color: #700000;">**RFB**</span>.

= The <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span>'s Proposal

Due to the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span>'s declining electoral performance, threatening to wipe out their Reichstag delegation come next election, many within their party like the retired Koch-Weser have been lobbying for a technical list connection with the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>.

Despite their electoral standing, many within their business wing like Theodor Heuss argue that allying with the <span style="color: #c00000;">socialists</span> would be detrimental to their stance of economic freedom, while many on their left wing such as Ernst Lemmer argue it's a necessity in order to save their party and democracy. We can either offer to help the dying party out, increasing their parliamentary presence, or leave them on their own.

- @ddp_alliance_yay: Offer to help the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span>.
- @ddp_alliance_reject: We are not saving the party of the bourgeoisie.

After their internal vote, the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span> accepts our offer, despite the opposition from whatever remains of the business wing. The party suffers electorally from their association with us, even if many right-wingers stress it as nothing more than a technical list connection. Anyhow, the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span> will receive more parliamentary seats now.

[? if ddp_ideology == "Left" and ddp_leader == "Lemmer": Lemmer has decided to take things a step further, and has further increased electoral cooperation between our parties. Perhaps this alliance will last more than just one election? ?]

Unfortunately, despite our offer for help, the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span> has rejected the list connection in an internal vote. Even in the state they're in currently, they still adamantly oppose any association with <span style="color: #c00000;">socialism</span>. Maybe they'll change their mind when the election results come through.

The transformation of the [? if z_party_name != "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span>?][? if z_party_name == "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">**CVP**</span>?] into an interconfessional party is now set in stone, but Stegerwald has made himself some enemies in doing so. Conservative Catholics have jumped ship [? if dnvp_ideology == "Moderate": to the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>.?][? if dnvp_ideology == "Radical": to the various right-wing parties that claim to have Catholic interests at heart.?] The left of the [? if z_party_name != "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span>?][? if z_party_name == "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">**CVP**</span>?] under Joseph Wirth has become a thorn in Stegerwald's side due to his antipathy towards the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>.

The reformation of the [? if z_party_name != "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span>?][? if z_party_name == "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">**CVP**</span>?] away from its confessional roots has injected a dose of <span class="tooltip-text" title="good mod">dynamism</span> into the party, making it more willing to change and evolve with current conditions. Jakob Kaiser is a rising star on the left, <span style="color: #FF7F00;">Christian Left</span> wing of the party, supporting Stegerwald's vision for a united Christian union but disagreeing with his right-wing policies. 

- @stegerwald: The [? if z_party_name != "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span>?][? if z_party_name == "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">**CVP**</span>?] elects Adam Stegerwald as the party chair.
- @kaiser: Influence the [? if z_party_name != "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span>?][? if z_party_name == "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">**CVP**</span>?] to select Jakob Kaiser as the party chair.
- @kaiser_campaign: We will hold a campaign in support of Jakob Kaiser as party chair.

Stegerwald will continue to evolve the [? if z_party_name != "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span>?][? if z_party_name == "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">**CVP**</span>?] into a <span style="color: #000000;">Christian</span>, <span style="color: #586593;">democratic</span>, <span style="color: #000000;">German</span>, and <span style="color: #c00000;">social</span> party. Hopefully, Joseph Wirth and the left wing of the party will be able to keep him in check. [? if dnvp_ideology == "Radical": However, the party will continue shifting to the right as it takes the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>'s place on the German right. ?]

[? if dnvp_ideology == "Moderate": Talks of a merger with the <span style='color: #3E88B3;'>**DNVP**</span> are becoming increasingly common—though support is limited to their <span style='color: #0087DC;'>People's Conservatives</span> and <span style='color: #6D5298;'>Christian Socialists</span>. A merger remains impossible without one of those factions having strong, centralized leadership within their party. At the same time, we must prevent any government cooperation between them and the <span style='color: #000000;'>Center</span>—lest we allow conditions for such a union to emerge. ?][? if dnvp_ideology == "Radical": A merger with the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> is out of the question—at least with Hugenberg commanding the party. Still, there remains fertile ground on the anti-Hugenberg right. ?]
